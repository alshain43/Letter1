        This is a letter that feels like my confession haha. <br>
        To be honest, I never realized it before - would I have been able to hold on if it wasn't for the person beside me? <br>
        At first , it was just like that , drifting along like a wave , and I got to know a girl . Then , we started sharing so many thoughts , talking about all kinds of things - happy moments , sad moments, funny stories and more! <br>
        I don't even know when exactly we became this close. But by the time I realized it , a thought had already settled in my mind : " No matter what , I don't want you to get hurt"!!! I have said it many times before , but I'll say it again - whatever happens , I'll always look out for your happiness . Please don't forget that. <br>
        And as for my short-tempered , easily saddened little puppy - whenever you're feeling down , I'll be there to listen and stay by your side.But plz , don't waste your tears on people who don't see your worth, OK :3 <br>
        <h4>Hmmmmm , I'm not in a position to make promises or ask for them either . But honestly , after I turn 30 , I wnat you to be the one by my side in my life &hearts; <br>
        I know I don't express things much or say them out loud , so writing this makes me feel a little shy :3 But still , I want you to know just how precious and lovable you are. <br>
        And no matter what happens , you'll always have this silly guy standing by your side!!!
        </h4> 
        <p>Since it's the month of love , I wanted to write something beautiful , but since I've never had bf/gf before , I don't really know how . So , it might not be all that beautiful - sorry for that TT
            <br>
            <h4>Lastly , eat well , sleep well , and even in this harsh world , try to find at least one beautiful part of life each day . Keep dreaming of big blue whales , and let's keep living on . <i>And plz , continue being my gray_precinct &hearts;</i></h4>
